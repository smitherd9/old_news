# Introduction:

[Old News](https://smitherd9.github.io/old_news/) is a web app that allows the user to search 
for news stories in the recent past.  It employs the New York Times' Article Search API and The Guardian's Open Platform
API.  The user can search for stories by date, by a date range and by a topic and date.

# Use Case:

Old News is intended for people with an interest in history and especially to counteract the negative
effects of living in a world with a 24 hour news cycle, which causes even recent, important
events to be forgotten and/or overlooked easily. 




# A Note About The Guardian API

Currently, the Guardian's Open Platform API only performs searches over http, which as Old News is hosted on Git Hub pages,
using https, this will throw an error in Chrome.  I intend to work out a solution for this later in the Thinkful
course after studying the back end.  For now, you can override this error in Chrome by clicking the icon that 
appears in the upper right of the search bar and then choosing to allow insecure scripts.
